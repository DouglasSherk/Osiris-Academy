### FACEBOOK CONFIGURATION VARIABLES ###

/**
 * To use Facebook you will first need to create a Facebook application:
 *    1.  Visit the "Create an Application" setup wizard:
 *        http://developers.facebook.com/setup/
 *    2.  Enter a descriptive name for your wiki in the Site Name field.
 *        This will be seen by users when they sign up for your site.
 *    3.  Enter the Site URL and Locale, then click "Create application".
 *    4.  Copy the displayed App ID and Secret into this config file.
 * 
 * Optionally, you may customize your application:
 *    A.  Click "developer dashboard" link on the previous screen or visit:
 *        http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php
 *    B.  Select your application and click "Edit Settings".
 *    C.  Upload icon and logo images. The icon appears in Stream stories.
 *    D.  If you need Facebook authentication across subdomains, specify the base
 *        domain in the "Web Site" section and copy it into this config file.
 *
 * It is recommended that, rather than changing the settings in this file, you
 * instead override them in LocalSettings.php by adding new settings after
 * require_once("$IP/extensions/Facebook/Facebook.php");

 *     fb-admin      An administrator of the Facebook group

 * Users will automatically be promoted or demoted when their membership, title
 * or admin status is modified from the group page within Facebook.
 * Unfortunately, this has a minor degredation on performance.

 * This setting can also be used in conjunction with $wgFbDisableLogin. To have
 * this group exclusively control access to the wiki, set $wgFbDisableLogin equal

 * # Disable reading and editing by anonymous users
 * $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
