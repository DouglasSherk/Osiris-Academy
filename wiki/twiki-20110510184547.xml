==MTE 204==


==MTE 220==



==MTE 241==

Questions Expected to Appear: The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:

    * 1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
    * 2. Unix fork operation.
    * 3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
    * 4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads. 

Two midterms with solutions are available on the EngSoc website.
[edit] Review Guideline

Review Advice from the prof:

    Review course overheads ch 1-3, RTOS, ch 4-6. 

    Review related chapters in the course text (ch 1-6) and the &quot;Example Design of a Non-Preemptive Real-Time Kernel&quot; document (RTOS). 

    Review Home Problems Set A and their solutions. 

    Review Example Midterm problems and their solutions. 

[edit] Room Allocation

Room assignment, by the first letter of last name:

    DWE 1502, letters A-C 

    DWE 1515, letters D-K 

    DWE 2536, letters L-S 

    DWE 3517, letters T-Z

Two midterms with solutions are available on the EngSoc website.

====Questions Expected to Appear====

The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:

* 1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
* 2. Unix fork operation.
* 3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
* 4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads. 

====Review Guideline====

Review Advice from the prof:

:Review course overheads ch 1-3, RTOS, ch 4-6. 

:Review related chapters in the course text (ch 1-6) and the &quot;Example Design of a Non-Preemptive Real-Time Kernel&quot; document (RTOS). 

:Review Home Problems Set A and their solutions. 

:Review Example Midterm problems and their solutions.

The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:

* 1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
* 2. Unix fork operation.
* 3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
* 4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads.

Two midterms with solutions are available on the EngSoc website.

====Questions Expected to Appear====

The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:

* 1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
* 2. Unix fork operation.
* 3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
* 4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads. 

====Review Resources====

Review Advice from the prof:

:Review course overheads ch 1-3, RTOS, ch 4-6. 

:Review related chapters in the course text (ch 1-6) and the &quot;Example Design of a Non-Preemptive Real-Time Kernel&quot; document (RTOS). 

:Review Home Problems Set A and their solutions. 

:Review Example Midterm problems and their solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Steps for Linear Plots==
1. Memorize all the basic plots and their angles. These were given in class, and are also given in the first few pages of the &quot;Introduction to Bode Plots&quot; PDF link.
2. Test function at T(j0) and T(j*infinity) to get end bounds.
3. Graph all basic plot parts as determined in step 1.
4. Plot final line, following the directions of the previously plotted basic parts.

==Tips==
*Most lines increase/decrease with a slope of 20db/dec. If a term is to a  higher power then multiply this slop by that power.

==Resources==
There is some material on Bode plots in the MTE120 book, &quot;Intro to Electric Circuits&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Choleski Method is useful for solving '''symmetric, positive''' matrices.

==Method==
The defining equation of this method is:

&lt;math&gt;[A]=[U]^{T}[U]&lt;/math&gt; 

Where U is an upper-triangular matrix including the diagonal. The elements of U are given by certain equations (available on the MTE 204 cheat-sheet).</text>

====width property=====

The width of the convolution of two signals is the sum of the width of the two signals. The width of a DT signal is one less than the length of the signal. The length of a signal is the number of elements in the signal. For example if a signal has three &quot;blips&quot;, then it has a length of three, and a width of two.

The convolution of two functions is solved using the following equation: &lt;math&gt;x[n] * g[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}x[m]g[n-m]&lt;/math&gt;

The result is often a geometric series. The series can be solved using this equation: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=m}^n ar^k=\frac{a(r^m-r^{n+1})}{1-r}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Overview ==

Cramer's Rule is an algorithm for solving a set of linear equations using Matrices. The examples given here use a 3*3 matrix since it is most common for us to use this based this size of a matrix.

== Formula ==

The rules for 3&amp;times;3 are similar.  Given &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix}ax + by + cz&amp;= {\color{red}j}\\dx + ey + fz&amp;= {\color{red}k}\\gx + hy + iz&amp;= {\color{red}l}\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt; which in matrix format is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}j} \\ {\color{red}k} \\ {\color{red}l} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; the values of ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' can be found as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac { \begin{vmatrix} {\color{red}j} &amp; b &amp; c \\ {\color{red}k} &amp; e &amp; f \\ {\color{red}l} &amp; h &amp; i \end{vmatrix} } { \begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i \end{vmatrix} }, \quad y = \frac { \begin{vmatrix} a &amp; {\color{red}j} &amp; c \\ d &amp; {\color{red}k} &amp; f \\ g &amp; {\color{red}l} &amp; i \end{vmatrix} } { \begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i \end{vmatrix} },\text{ and }z = \frac { \begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; {\color{red}j} \\ d &amp; e &amp; {\color{red}k} \\ g &amp; h &amp; {\color{red}l} \end{vmatrix} } { \begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i \end{vmatrix} }.&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(a,b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;f_{x}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist
# &lt;math&gt;f_{y}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist

==Relative Maxima / Minima==

====Find Critical Points====
To find a maximum or minimum of an equation, the points of interest are those in which the gradient of the function is equal to zero. To find these points solve for:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} = 0 \qquad \frac{d^2 f}{dy^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and substitue these equations into one another.

====Find Max/Min====
Once the critical points have been found, you must determine whether each is a max or a min. To do this use the second derivative test:

:&lt;math&gt;A=f_{xx}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B=f_{yy}(a,b) \qquad \qquad D=A*C - B^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=f_{xy}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

if:
::&lt;math&gt;D &gt; 0 \quad and \quad A &lt; 0 \quad ==&gt; \quad Relative Max&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;D &gt; 0 \quad and \quad A &gt; 0 \quad ==&gt; \quad Relative Min&lt;/math&gt;</text>

===Solving Difference Equations===
====Zero-Input Response====
*1.Set the input (x[n]) to 0. Replace time-shifts with E. (eg: y[n+2] = E^2y[n]) Therefore: &lt;math&gt;Q[E]y_0[n] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*2.Create the characteristic equation of the system, &lt;math&gt;Q[\lambda] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*3.Solve the characteristic equation, the characteristic roots are  &lt;math&gt;\gamma^n&lt;/math&gt;'s
*4.Based on what type of roots exist, create the characteristic modes:
**'''Real Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma_1^n + c_2\gamma_2^n + ... + c_n\gamma_n^n&lt;/math&gt;
**'''Repeated Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma_1^n + c_2n\gamma_1^n + ... + c_nn^n\gamma_n^n&lt;/math&gt;
**'''Complex Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma^n + c_2(\gamma*)^n = c|\gamma|^ncos(\beta n + \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

===Unit Impulse Response===
Solve the equation &lt;math&gt;Q[E]y[n] = P[E]x[n]&lt;/math&gt; for the input&lt;math&gt;\delta [n]&lt;/math&gt;
*1.Set &lt;math&gt;x[n]=\delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;
*2.Set all initial conditions to zero.

i.e.: solve this equation setting all initial conditions to zero. &lt;math&gt;Q[E]h[n] = P[E]\delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;

===Zero State Response===
&lt;math&gt;y_{zsr} = x[n]*h[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}x[m]h[n-m]&lt;/math&gt;

===Classical Method of Solving Difference Equations===
The classical method says that the total response of a system is equal to the natural response of the system (all characteristic modes) plus the force response of the system (the remaining non-characteristic mode terms).

&lt;math&gt;Total Response = y_c[n] + y-\phi[n]&lt;/math&gt;

===Parallel Systems===
For two systems in parallel, add their effects together to obtain the total effect. ie: &lt;math&gt;s_1 + s_2 = S_T&lt;/math&gt;

===Series Systems===
For multiple systems in series,

&lt;math&gt;{\buildrel x[n] \over \longrightarrow} [S_1] {\buildrel y_1[n] \over \longrightarrow} [S_2] {\buildrel y[n] \over \longrightarrow} &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt; y = x[n] * ( h_1[n] * h_2[n] )&lt;/math&gt; where h[n] is the unit impulse response of the respective system.

==Stability==

Imagine a unit circle on the Real/Imaginary cartesian plot. If both poles are inside this circle, the system is stable. If they are on the circle's perimeter, the system is marginally stable. If the poles lie outside the circle, the system is unstable.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A discrete system is a sequence of numbers. It differs from a continuous time system in that an output value is ''not'' defined at for every time ''t'', but rather only for specific values of time.

==Strength of a Signal==

The '''energy''' of a signal is defined as: &lt;math&gt;E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \abs{x[n]}^2 &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Power''' of a signal is defined as: &lt;math&gt;P_x = {1 \over N} \sum_0^{N-1} \abs {x[n]}^2&lt;/math&gt;. This only applies to periodic signals.

==Signal Operations==

Time Shifting: &lt;math&gt;x[n] \to x[n - M]&lt;/math&gt;

Time Reversal: &lt;math&gt;x[n] \to x[-n]&lt;/math&gt;

Decimation:  &lt;math&gt;x[n] \to x[Mn]&lt;/math&gt; *Note that information can be lost when something is decimated (hence the name). Example on p. 184 of textbook (Intl')

==Special Functions in DT==

===Unit Step Function===
&lt;math&gt;u[n] =  {1, n \leq 0 \brace 0, n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;

===Unit Impulse Function===

&lt;math&gt;\delta[n] =  {1, n = 0 \brace 0, n \neq 0}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Difference Equation==

===Solving Difference Equations===
====Zero-Input Response====
*1.Set the input (x[n]) to 0. Replace time-shifts with E. (eg: y[n+2] = E^2y[n]) Therefore: &lt;math&gt;Q[E]y_0[n] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*2.Create the characteristic equation of the system, &lt;math&gt;Q[\lambda] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*3.Solve the characteristic equation, the characteristic roots are  &lt;math&gt;\gamma^n&lt;/math&gt;'s
*4.Based on what type of roots exist, create the characteristic modes:
**'''Real Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma_1^n + c_2\gamma_2^n + ... + c_n\gamma_n^n&lt;/math&gt;
**'''Repeated Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma_1^n + c_2n\gamma_1^n + ... + c_nn^n\gamma_n^n&lt;/math&gt;
**'''Complex Roots''': &lt;math&gt;y_0[n] = c_1\gamma^n + c_2(\gamma*)^n = c|\gamma|^ncos(\beta n + \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

===Unit Impulse Response===
Solve the equation &lt;math&gt;Q[E]y[n] = P[E]x[n]&lt;/math&gt; for the input&lt;math&gt;\delta [n]&lt;/math&gt;
*1.Set &lt;math&gt;x[n]=\delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;
*2.Set all initial conditions to zero.

i.e.: solve this equation setting all initial conditions to zero. &lt;math&gt;Q[E]h[n] = P[E]\delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;

====Closed Form solution to find H[n]====
 &lt;math&gt;h[n]=A_0\delta[n] + y_c[n]u[n]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_0 &lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;b_N\over a_N&lt;/math&gt;

===Zero State Response===
&lt;math&gt;y_{zsr} = x[n]*h[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}x[m]h[n-m]&lt;/math&gt;

===Classical Method of Solving Difference Equations===
The classical method says that the total response of a system is equal to the natural response of the system (all characteristic modes) plus the force response of the system (the remaining non-characteristic mode terms).

&lt;math&gt;Total Response = y_c[n] + y-\phi[n]&lt;/math&gt;

==Classification of Discrete Time Systems==

===Linear/Non-linear===
incomplete...

===Time Invariant===
incomplete...

===Causal/Non-Causal===
Same as in Continuous Time

===Memory/Memoryless===
Same as in continuous time

==Convolution==
Discrete time convolution is discussed on the [[Convolution]] page.

==Connected Systems==
Connected systems behave differently in DT then in CT.

===Parallel Systems===
For two systems in parallel, add their effects together to obtain the total effect. ie: &lt;math&gt;s_1 + s_2 = S_T&lt;/math&gt;

===Series Systems===
For multiple systems in series,

&lt;math&gt;{\buildrel x[n] \over \longrightarrow} [S_1] {\buildrel y_1[n] \over \longrightarrow} [S_2] {\buildrel y[n] \over \longrightarrow} &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt; y = x[n] * ( h_1[n] * h_2[n] )&lt;/math&gt; where h[n] is the unit impulse response of the respective system.

==Stability==

Imagine a unit circle on the Real/Imaginary cartesian plot. If both poles are inside this circle, the system is stable. If they are on the circle's perimeter, the system is marginally stable. If the poles lie outside the circle, the system is unstable.

The official rules are:
*1. Asymptotically stable iff ''all'' characteristic roots are inside the unit circle. They may be repeated, simple or complex.
*2. Unstable iff at least one root is outside the unit circle or there are repeated roots on the unit circle.
*3. Marginally stable if some roots are on the unit circle, and no roots are repeated.</text>

The Gauss-Jordan Elimination method closely resembles the [[Gauss Elimination Method]] except that on additional step performed on the Augmented Matrix. The matrix is reduced to all zeros except for the diagonal (which is reduced to 1's) and the solution column which may contain any values.

== Determining the Inverse of a Matrix==
The Gauss-Jordan Elimination method may be used to determine the inverse of a matrix.

The following example demonstrates this process.

&lt;math&gt;[C] = [[A|I]] = \left( \begin{array}{cccccc}
a_{1,1} &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
a_{1,1} &amp; &amp; &amp;0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
a_{1,1} &amp; &amp; &amp;0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;</text>

The G-J Method is then applied to the matrix, and when the process is complete, I is replaced with the inverse of A (yay!).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember this one from first year Algebra.

== Goal ==
To solve a system of linear equations

== Method ==
*1. Transform the system of equations into Augmented Matrix form.

*2. Reduce the matrix to 1's across the diagonal, and 0's to the bottom-right of the diagonal (Except for the last column which can hold any values) using the three elementary operations (see below).
&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
1 &amp; x &amp; x &amp; val\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; x &amp; val\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; val\end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
*3. Then solve the reduced equations normally keeping in mind that the first column represents the first variable, second column represents second variable etc...

== The Three Elementary Operations ==
The following operations can be used on any rows of the matrix. These operations are used to reduce the matrix to the desired form.

*1. Multiply any row by a constant.
*2. Add one row to another row.
*3. Rearrange the orders of the rows.</text>

==Transfer Functions==

The transfer function ( H(s) ) of a system is equal to the input ( P(s) ) over the output ( Q(s) ).

&lt;math&gt;H(s) = {P(s) \over Q(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

As well, the Transfer function and the Unit Impulse Response of a system are closely related in that they are the Laplace transforms of each other.

==Solving ODEs Using Laplace Transforms==
Laplace transforms can help solve ODEs. It is often easier to solve a complex ODE using this method then other methods.

To solve an ODE, follow these steps:

*1. Take the Laplace Transform of both sides, considering the I.C's at time t = 0-. The following equation is used here: &lt;math&gt;L[y^{(n)}(t)] = s^nY(s) - s^{n-1}y(0) - s^{n-2}y'(0) - ... - y^{n-1}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
*2. Solve for Y(s). Often partial fractions are used to get the function into a form that it easily transformed back into the time domain.
*3. Perform the inverse laplace transform to transform the function back into the time domain.</text>

The final result will be of the form:

&lt;math&gt;y = a_{0} + a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt;


Although this result can be obtained using matrix manipulation, the end result can be described by the two following equations:


&lt;math&gt;
a_{0} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x^{2}_{i} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}}
{n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x^{2}_{i} - (\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
a_{1} = \frac{n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} }
{n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x^{2}_{i} - (\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}

Used to solve a system of linear equations.

==Overview==
Any square matrix [A] can be written as a combination of two matrices such that: &lt;math&gt;[A]=[L][U]&lt;/math&gt;

== Upper Matrix ==
The following is an example of an upper matrix:
&lt;math&gt;[U] = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
u_{1,1} &amp; u_{1,2} &amp; u_{1,3} \\
0 &amp; u_{2,2} &amp; u_{2,3} \\

==Compiled Exam Information==

Questions Expected to Appear:
The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:
1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
2. Unix fork operation.
3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads.

Two midterms with solutions are available on the EngSoc website.

==Compiled Exam Information==

Questions Expected to Appear:
The prof said that there will be four questions on the exam, closely following the format of previous year's exams. They will cover the following topics:
*1. RTOS, project based question. This will probably involve making a modification to the existing project base.
*2. Unix fork operation.
*3. Disk I/O, I/O transfer.
*4. A mash-up of smaller questions, for example, something about processes/threads.

Two midterms with solutions are available on the EngSoc website.

So far my associates and my experience with MathCAD has been one of playing with finicky syntax over any beneficial harnessing of computer power. It seems to be a lesser known cousin of the better known MATLAB, where reasons of why we use the sooner are beyond me. Complaints aside, the following are simple fixes to common syntax problems:
*MathCAD executes from top-to-bottom. Using a variable to the right of where you declared it may result in an error as it is located slightly above the declaration
*MathCAD re-executes all items following (below) a change made to your code
*Using a &quot;.&quot; as a shortcut to subscript of (ex. &lt;math&gt; A.1 = &gt;A_{1}&lt;/math&gt; ) is sometimes not considered the same as clicking the subtext button, like when specifying points from a matrix &lt;math&gt; f(x_{1},y_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;.
*Pressing Ctrl + '=' instead of just '='; they are indistinguishable in the Lab tutorial notes, but mean a world of difference. Ctrl + '=' is used after a 'Given' statement, when setting an existing function to a value, ex. &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; to solve the roots. The ':=' is used to set a variable to a certain value, and plain old '=' returns the value stored in a variable.

I recommended doing the tutorial before or in tandem with this lab as it tells you everything you need to know. Horray. However, as a few of us found out, you can get away with some major syntax error in the tutorial and still get the right answers because there is only one critical point, but the lab will not work. A few hints for this one include:
* For the i..n command; there is a '..' symbol in the ''Matrix'' toolbar
* TODO</text>

*Using a &quot;.&quot; as a shortcut to subscript of (ex. &lt;math&gt; A.1 = &gt;A_{1}&lt;/math&gt; ) is sometimes not considered the same as clicking the subtext button, like when specifying points from a matrix &lt;math&gt; f(x_{1},y_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;.
*Pressing 'Ctrl + =' instead of just '='; they are indistinguishable in the Lab tutorial notes, but mean a world of difference. Ctrl + '=' is used after a 'Given' statement, when setting an existing function to a value, ex. &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; to solve the roots. The ':=' is used to set a variable to a certain value, and plain old '=' returns the value stored in a variable.

== Lab 2 Help ==
I recommended doing the tutorial before or in tandem with this lab as it tells you everything you need to know. Horray. However, as a few of us found out, you can get away with some major syntax error in the tutorial and still get the right answers because there is only one critical point, but the lab will not work. A few hints for this one include:
* For the i..n command; there is a '..' symbol in the ''Matrix'' toolbar
* The above syntax problems are always an issue
* Because there are two critical points, remember to calculate the Hessian for &lt;math&gt;f(x_{1},y_{1})&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;f(x_{2},y_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

Finding the extrema (maximums, minimums and saddle points [which are the equivalent of points of inflection in 2d calc]) draws many similarities to two-dimensional calculus, but it admittedly a bit harder.

===The first derivative test===
At a relative maximum of a function f where x=a and y=b, the then first partial derivatives equal zero, as does the gradient of the function. ie:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial x^2} = 0
 \frac{\partial^2U}{\partial y^2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;</text>

Finding critical points is a key concept in calculus as it allows you to find optimized values in many situations.

A critical point of a graph is defined as a point which satitsfies one of the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(a,b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;f_{x}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist
# &lt;math&gt;f_{y}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist

At a '''relative maximum''' of a function f where x=a and y=b, the then first partial derivatives equal zero, as does the gradient of the function. ie:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2} = 0 , \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2} = 0 , \vec {\nabla f}_{a,b} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A point (a,b) is a '''critical point''' if one of the following is true:

*&lt;math&gt;\vec {\nabla f}_{a,b} = \vec 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and/ or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

A point (a,b) is a '''saddle point''' when &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&gt;f(a,b) &amp; f(x,y)&lt;f(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

====Second Derivative Test====
Once the location of the critical points has been determined with the 1st derivative test, the second derivative test helps classify what type of critical point it is.

=====Procedure=====
Define three variables: &lt;math&gt;A=f_{xx}(a,b), B = f_{xy}(a,b), C = f_{yy}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, and determine the Hessian of F which is called D. &lt;math&gt;D(a,b)=A*C-B^2&lt;/math&gt;

Then, if:
*D &gt; 0 and A &lt; 0, (a,b) is a relative maximum
*D &gt; 0 and A &gt; 0, (a,b) is a relative minimum
*D &lt; 0, (a,b) is a saddle point
*D = 0, (a,b) may be a relative maximum or minimum or a saddle point (this case is not covered in MTE 203)

Finding critical points is a key concept in calculus as it allows you to find optimized values in many situations.

A critical point of a graph is defined as a point which satitsfies one of the following conditions:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gradient ==
The gradient of a function points in the direction of greatest increase.

&lt;math&gt;\vec {\nabla f} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} i + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} j &lt;/math&gt;

== Extrema of Functions ==

===Relative Maxima/Minima===
Finding the extrema (maximums, minimums and saddle points [which are the equivalent of points of inflection in 2d calc]) draws many similarities to two-dimensional calculus, but it admittedly a bit harder.

====The first derivative test====
At a '''relative maximum''' of a function f where x=a and y=b, the then first partial derivatives equal zero, as does the gradient of the function. ie:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 , \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0 , \vec {\nabla f}_{a,b} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A point (a,b) is a '''critical point''' if one of the following is true:

*&lt;math&gt;\vec {\nabla f}_{a,b} = \vec 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and/ or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

A point (a,b) is a '''saddle point''' when &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&gt;f(a,b) &amp; f(x,y)&lt;f(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

====Second Derivative Test====
Once the location of the critical points has been determined with the 1st derivative test, the second derivative test helps classify what type of critical point it is.

=====Procedure=====
Define three variables: &lt;math&gt;A=f_{xx}(a,b), B = f_{xy}(a,b), C = f_{yy}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, and determine the Hessian of F which is called D. &lt;math&gt;D(a,b)=B^2 - A*C&lt;/math&gt;

Then, if:
*D &lt; 0 and A &lt; 0, (a,b) is a relative maximum
*D &lt; 0 and A &gt; 0, (a,b) is a relative minimum
*D &gt; 0, (a,b) is a saddle point
*D = 0, (a,b) may be a relative maximum or minimum or a saddle point (this case is not covered in MTE 203)

Finding critical points is a key concept in calculus as it allows you to find optimized values in many situations.

A critical point of a graph is defined as a point which satitsfies one of the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(a,b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;f_{x}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist
# &lt;math&gt;f_{y}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist

===Absolute Maxima / Minima===

====Procedure====
*'''Find Relative Maxima / Minima'''
To find the relative maxima and minima, see the section above. 

*'''Find Boundary Maxima / Minima (Extrema)'''
Find the equation of the boundary. This is done by parameterizing the boundary and then substituting the results obtained into the original surface's function. Then evaluate it to determine what the maxima/minima of the boundary equations are.

*'''Evaluate and Characterize Absolute Maximum / Minimum'''

This step is the easiest of the three steps. To find the absolute maximum or minimum, evaluate the value of the function at each of the critical points identified in the previous steps. Then compare them to the relative maxima and minima found in the function and determine which are absolute extrema.</text>

==Lagrange Multipliers==

Lagrange Multipliers allow allow us to find the maximums and minimums on the boundary of an equation, by subjecting it to a cosntraint.

The constraint is called g. The function is f. At the extremum located on the boundary of f, the gradients of f and g are equal. Therefore we try to solve the following equation.

&lt;math&gt;\nablaf = \lambda \nabla g&lt;/math&gt;

Our goal is to find the values of lambda that satisfy this equation. Then we find the associated X, Y points and those are the critical points on the boundary of f. Then characterize these critical points.</text>

Just in case it comes in handy, the basic definition of a derivative is:

&lt;math&gt;{df(x)\over dx}\mid_{x_0} = lim_{x\to x_0} {f(x) - f(x_0) \over x - x_0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic Finite Difference Approximations==
There are three ways discussed in MTE 204 to numerically approximate derivatives. These are the most commonly used methods of approximating derivatives.Their formulae follow.
===Two Point Forward-Difference Approximations===

&lt;math&gt; x = x_i + \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i+1} - x_i} = {f_{i+1} - f_i \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point forward-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt; x = x_i - \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i-1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} = {f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} ={f_{i} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point central-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}} = {f_{i+1} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Taylor Series approximation method leads to some error. IE, the calculated value of the derivative is not the exact value but merely an approximation of that value. The error of the ''n''th term is calculated by:

&lt;math&gt;R_n = {(x - x_i)^{n + 1} \over (n + 1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi) = {(\Delta x)^{(n+1)} \over (n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_n = {(x - x_i)^{n + 1} \over (n + 1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi) = {(\Delta x)^{(n+1)} \over (n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a value between x_i and x.

This error is reduced as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is reduced.

==Finite-Difference Approximation of Second Derivatives==
Expanding on the finite-difference approximations of first derivatives, we can find equations of the forward-difference, backward-difference and central difference of second derivatives.

===Backward Difference Approximation===

==Definition of a Derivative==
Just in case it comes in handy, the basic definition of a derivative is:

&lt;math&gt;{df(x)\over dx}\mid_{x_0} = lim_{x\to x_0} {f(x) - f(x_0) \over x - x_0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic Finite Difference Approximations==
There are three ways discussed in MTE 204 to numerically approximate derivatives. These are the most commonly used methods of approximating derivatives.Their formulae follow.
===Two Point Forward-Difference Approximations===

&lt;math&gt; x = x_i + \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i+1} - x_i} = {f_{i+1} - f_i \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point backard-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt; x = x_i - \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i-1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} = {f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} ={f_{i} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point central-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}} = {f_{i+1} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Using Taylor Series Expansions==
Taylor series expansions can be used to numerically determine derivatives. Barring the derivation of this method (as usual...) the useful equations follow.

For &lt;math&gt;x = x_i - \Delta x&lt;/math&gt; the derivative of f is:

&lt;math&gt; f(x_i + \Delta x) = f(x_i) + \Delta x f'(x_i) + {\Delta x^2 \over 2!}f''(x_i) - {\Delta x^3 \over 3!}f'''(x_i) + ... + {(-\Delta x)^n \over n!}f^{(n)}(x_i) + ...&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Taylor Series approximation method leads to some error. IE, the calculated value of the derivative is not the exact value but merely an approximation of that value. The error of the ''n''th term is calculated by:

&lt;math&gt;R_n = {(x - x_i)^{n + 1} \over (n + 1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi) = {(\Delta x)^{(n+1)} \over (n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The topic of Numerical Differentiation is discussed in MTE 204 lecture #21.

==Definition of a Derivative==
Just in case it comes in handy, the basic definition of a derivative is:

&lt;math&gt;{df(x)\over dx}\mid_{x_0} = lim_{x\to x_0} {f(x) - f(x_0) \over x - x_0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic Finite Difference Approximations==
There are three ways discussed in MTE 204 to numerically approximate derivatives. These are the most commonly used methods of approximating derivatives.Their formulae follow.
===Two Point Forward-Difference Approximations===

&lt;math&gt; x = x_i + \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i+1} - x_i} = {f_{i+1} - f_i \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point backard-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt; x = x_i - \Delta x, \Delta x &gt; 0:&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i-1}) - f(x_{i}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} = {f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i-1} - x_i} ={f_{i} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two point central-difference approximation===
&lt;math&gt;{f'(x) \approx {f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1}) \over x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}} = {f_{i+1} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Using Taylor Series Expansions==
Taylor series expansions can be used to numerically determine derivatives. Barring the derivation of this method (as usual...) the useful equations follow.

For &lt;math&gt;x = x_i - \Delta x&lt;/math&gt; the derivative of f is:

&lt;math&gt; f(x_i + \Delta x) = f(x_i) + \Delta x f'(x_i) + {\Delta x^2 \over 2!}f''(x_i) - {\Delta x^3 \over 3!}f'''(x_i) + ... + {(-\Delta x)^n \over n!}f^{(n)}(x_i) + ...&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Taylor Series approximation method leads to some error. IE, the calculated value of the derivative is not the exact value but merely an approximation of that value. The error of the ''n''th term is calculated by:

&lt;math&gt;R_n = {(x - x_i)^{n + 1} \over (n + 1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi) = {(\Delta x)^{(n+1)} \over (n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a value between x_i and x.

This error is reduced as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is reduced.

==Finite-Difference Approximation of Second Derivatives==
Expanding on the finite-difference approximations of first derivatives, we can find equations of the forward-difference, backward-difference and central difference of second derivatives.

===Forward Difference Approximation===
&lt;math&gt;f''_i \approx { f_{i+2} - 2f_{i+1} + f_i \over \Delta x^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
 operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;
===Backward Difference Approximation===
&lt;math&gt;f''_i \approx { f_{i}-2f_{i-1} + f_{i-2} \over \Delta x^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

===Central Difference Approximation===

&lt;math&gt;f''_i \approx { f_{i+1} - 2f_{i} + f_{i-1} \over \Delta x^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

==Finite Difference Approximations for Higher Order Derivatives==
Forward, central and backward approximations can be determined for any order derivative. The equations are given in MTE 204 lecture 22, and in the course textbook.

==Approximations of Derivatives using Difference Operators==

This offers a different approach for approximating derivatives of any order.

===Important Operators===
'''Forward Difference''' operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_i = f_{i+1} - f_i&lt;/math&gt;


'''Backward Difference''' operator &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla f_i = f_{i} - f_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Central Difference''' operator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta f_i = f_{i+{1 \over 2}} - f_{i- {1 \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Powers of Operators====
An operator can be squared etc as such: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^2 = \Delta(\Delta)&lt;/math&gt;

====Examples====
The derivatives can be obtained using the operators as in the following examples:
'''Forward Difference'''
&lt;math&gt;{{df \over dx} \approx {\Delta f \over \Delta x} = {f_{i+1} - f_i \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Backward Difference'''
&lt;math&gt;{{df \over dx} \approx {\nabla f \over \Delta x} ={f_{i} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Central Difference'''
&lt;math&gt;{{{df \over dx} \approx {\delta f \over \Delta x}} = {f_{i+1} - f_{i-1} \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Finite Difference Approximations of Partial Derivatives==
===First Partials===
'''Forward Difference'''

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial x^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_{i+1},y_j) - f(x_i,y_j) \over \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial y^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_i,y_{j+1}) - f(x_i,y_j) \over \Delta y&lt;/math&gt;

'''Backward Difference'''

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial x^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_{i-1},y_j) - f(x_i,y_j) \over \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial y^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_i,y_{j-1}) - f(x_i,y_j) \over \Delta y&lt;/math&gt;

'''Central Difference'''

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial x^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_{i+1},y_j) - f(x_{i-1},y_j) \over 2\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial^2 f(x,y) \over \partial y^2}\vert x_i,y_j \approx {f(x_i,y_{j+1}) - f(x_i,y_{j-1}) \over 2\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;

===Second Partials===
Second partials were also covered in MTE204, the equations are given in the book (end of lecture #22).</text>

===Trapezoidal Rule===
A series of trapezoids are used to approximate the area under a curve.

====Method====

&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}h&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; I = \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}) = h{f_0 + f_n \over 2} + h \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f_i&lt;/math&gt;

I is the integral of the function.

===Simpson's Rule===
Simpson's rule uses higher order polynomials to approximate the area under a curve.

====The One-Third Rule====

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx = \sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} I_i \approx {h \over 3}(\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_{i-1} + 4f_i + f{i+1}))={h \over 3}(f_0 + 4\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_i + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=2,4,6...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;

====One-Eighth Rule====

Similar to One-Third rule except that third order polynomials are used to approximate the curve.

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx \approx {3h\over 8}(f_0 + 3\sum_{1=1,4,7...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_{i+2} + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=3,6,9...}^{n-3} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;</text>

This method involves replacing the function to be integrated by an approximating function (Pm(x)) which is easier to integrate. The following rules help to determine Pm(x).

===Rectangular Rule===
A series of rectangles are used to approximate the area under a curve.

====Method====
Find points &lt;math&gt;x_i = a + ih , i=1,2,3...n&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = f_i&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
*1.&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx f_ih \to \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f_i)&lt;/math&gt;
*2.&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx f_{i+1}h \to \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=1}^n f_i)&lt;/math&gt;
*3.&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx {f_i+f_{i+1} \over 2}h \to \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} {f_i+f_{i+1} \over 2})&lt;/math&gt;

===Trapezoidal Rule===
A series of trapezoids are used to approximate the area under a curve.

====Method====

&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}h&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; I = \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}) = h{f_0 + f_n \over 2} + h \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f_i&lt;/math&gt;

I is the integral of the function.

===Simpson's Rule===
Simpson's rule uses higher order polynomials to approximate the area under a curve.

====The One-Third Rule====

Second order polynomials are used to approximate the area under the curve.

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx = \sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} I_i \approx {h \over 3}(\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_{i-1} + 4f_i + f{i+1}))={h \over 3}(f_0 + 4\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_i + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=2,4,6...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;

====One-Eighth Rule====

Similar to One-Third rule except that third order polynomials are used to approximate the curve.

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx \approx {3h\over 8}(f_0 + 3\sum_{1=1,4,7...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_{i+2} + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=3,6,9...}^{n-3} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;</text>

&lt;math&gt;I_i \approx {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}h&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; I = \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx h(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {f_i + f_{i+1} \over 2}) = h{f_0 + f_n \over 2} + h \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f_i&lt;/math&gt;

I is the integral of the function.

===Simpson's Rule===
Simpson's rule uses higher order polynomials to approximate the area under a curve.

====The One-Third Rule====

Second order polynomials are used to approximate the area under the curve.

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx = \sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} I_i \approx {h \over 3}(\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_{i-1} + 4f_i + f{i+1}))={h \over 3}(f_0 + 4\sum_{1=1,3,5...}^{n-1} (f_i + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=2,4,6...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;

====One-Eighth Rule====

Similar to One-Third rule except that third order polynomials are used to approximate the curve.

&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^bf(x)dx \approx {3h\over 8}(f_0 + 3\sum_{1=1,4,7...}^{n-2} (f_i + f_{i+2} + 2)) + 2\sum_{1=3,6,9...}^{n-3} (f_i + f_n))&lt;/math&gt;


==Richardson's Extrapolation==

These formulas help achieve a more accurate integral by interpolating between two approximated integrals.

===R.E. as it Applies to the Trapezoidal Rule===
&lt;math&gt;I \approx I_1h_1 + {I_11h_1 - I_2h_2 \over ({h_2 \over h_1})^2 -1}&lt;/math&gt;

===R.E. as it Applies to Simpson's One-Third Rule===
&lt;math&gt;I \approx I_1h_1 + {I_11h_1 - I_2h_2 \over ({h_2 \over h_1})^4 -1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Gauss Quadrature Method==
The main advantage of using this method is that you do not need to evaluate the integral at multiple points as they are calculated as part of the method.

===Method===
*1.Coordinate transformation: &lt;math&gt;dx \to {a-b\over 2}d\bar x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;I \approx{b-a\over 2}\sum_{i=1}^n(w_i \bar f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;

Where n is a predefined number of Gauss points. xi and wi are Gauss points and weights.

With &lt;math&gt;x = \varphi(\bar x) = a + {\bar x + 1 \over 2}(b - a)&lt;/math&gt;

*2.Calculate the Gauss points and weights. This process will be described in the following sections.

*3.


See 2-poitn quadrature for a condensed application of this method.

===Calculation of Gauss Points and Weights===

====2-Point Gauss Quadrature====
Two Gauss points are taken.

&lt;math&gt;f(\varpi( \bar x)) = f(a + {\bar x + 1 \over 2}(b - a))&lt;/math&gt;

It is hard to apply the method with more than 2 Gauss points. More than 2 points were not covered in MTE 204.

==Gauss-Legendre Method==
===n-Point Gauss-Legendre Quadrature Formula===

&lt;math&gt; I \approx {b-a\over 2}\sum_{i=1}^n(w_i\bar f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;

The weights are given by:

&lt;math&gt;w_i = {{2(1-x_i^2)} \over {(nP_{n-1}(x_i))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

==High Order Taylor's Series Methods==
The following approximation is called a &quot;Taylor's Series Method of Order n&quot;

&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} \approx y_i + \Delta xf(x_i,y_i) + {\Delta x^2 \over 2}f'(x_i,y_i) + {\Delta x^3 \over 3!}f''(x_i,y_i) + ... + {\Delta x^n \over n!}f^{(n-1)}(x_i,y_i)&lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Systems of ODE's==
A system of first order ordinary differential equations can be numerically solved applying the same procedures as in the case of a single differential equation... (just make a system of the methods' equations and solve?)</text>

Linear regression was covered in MTE 201 (Statistics) and MTE 204 (Numerical Methods)

===Goal===
Linear regression fits the best straight line approximation to a set of data points.

===Procedure===
*A set of data points &lt;math&gt;(x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})&lt;/math&gt; should be given
*The equation of the regression line is &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}+a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}, a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; are constants we are about to determine.
*The error between the line and any given data point &lt;math&gt;(x_{i},y_{i})&lt;/math&gt; is given by the equation: &lt;math&gt;e_{i}=y_{i}-a_{0}-a_{1}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
*The coefficients &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; are calculated as follows:


&lt;math&gt;a_{0} = {\sum{y_{i}}\sum{x_{i}^2} - \sum{x_{i}}\sum{x_{i}y_{i}} \over n\sum{x_{i}^2} - (\sum{x_{i}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;a_{1} = {n\sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - \sum{y_{i}}\sum{x_{i}} \over n\sum{x_{i}^2} - (\sum{x_{i}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Correlation coefficient===
The correlation coefficient (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is used to indicate how strong the correlation between the regression line and data points is. r rangers from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being a perfect correlation. It is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 = {S_{0}} - S \over S_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

With:

&lt;math&gt; S = \sum{(y_i - a_0 - a_ix_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{0} = \sum{(y_{i} - \bar y)^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_{1} = {n\sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - \sum{y_{i}}\sum{x_{i}} \over n\sum{x_{i}^2} - (\sum{x_{i}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Correlation coefficient===
The correlation coefficient (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is used to indicate how strong the correlation between the regression line and data points is. r rangers from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being a perfect correlation. It is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 = {S_{0}} - S \over S_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

With:

&lt;math&gt; S = \sum{(y_i - a_0 - a_ix_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{0} = \sum{(y_{i} - \bar y)^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Polynomial Regression==
MTE 204 lecture #19 notes (available on ACE) were reference while writing this section.

===Procedure===
*The general form of the polynomial of best fit is: &lt;math&gt;y = a_0 +a_1x +a_2x^2 + ... + A_mx^m&lt;/math&gt;
*The sum of squares of the regression is given by &lt;math&gt;S=\sum{(y_i - a_0 - a_1x_i - a_2x_i^2 - ... - a_mx_i^m)^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linear Regression==
Linear regression was covered in MTE 201 (Statistics) and MTE 204 (Numerical Methods). MTE 204 lecture #19 notes (available on ACE) were reference while writing this section.

===Goal===
Linear regression fits the best straight line approximation to a set of data points.

===Links===
Useful document on [http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu/mws/gen/05inp/mws_gen_inp_txt_spline.pdf Spline Curve Fitting]

===Procedure===
*A set of data points &lt;math&gt;(x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})&lt;/math&gt; should be given
*The equation of the regression line is &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}+a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}, a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; are constants we are about to determine.
*The error between the line and any given data point &lt;math&gt;(x_{i},y_{i})&lt;/math&gt; is given by the equation: &lt;math&gt;e_{i}=y_{i}-a_{0}-a_{1}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
*The coefficients &lt;math&gt;y=a_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{1}x&lt;/math&gt; are calculated as follows:


&lt;math&gt;a_{0} = {\sum{y_{i}}\sum{x_{i}^2} - \sum{x_{i}}\sum{x_{i}y_{i}} \over n\sum{x_{i}^2} - (\sum{x_{i}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;a_{1} = {n\sum{x_{i}y_{i}} - \sum{y_{i}}\sum{x_{i}} \over n\sum{x_{i}^2} - (\sum{x_{i}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Correlation coefficient===
The correlation coefficient (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is used to indicate how strong the correlation between the regression line and data points is. r rangers from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being a perfect correlation. It is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 = {{S_{0} - S} \over S_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

With:

&lt;math&gt; S = \sum{(y_i - a_0 - a_ix_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{0} = \sum{(y_{i} - \bar y)^2&lt;/math&gt;

*The general form of the polynomial of best fit is: &lt;math&gt;y = a_0 +a_1x +a_2x^2 + ... + A_mx^m&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This philosophy is still being developed, but please have a read of it in its current form.

The Twiki aspires to provide a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and NBS (No Bullshit) version of all the information provided in UW Mechatronics courses, lectures and labs.

The goal at the end of the day is to create a set of notes which provide the information necessary to understand course material and help each student complete their assignments, labs, project and exams. Every bit of information a Tron student learns on their own and says &quot;Damn, I wish they has just ''told'' me that in class&quot; should be present on the twiki.

Bullshit which is not welcome on the Twiki include long, pointless derivations and pointless notes that profs give us saying &quot;you will never need this for this course, or life&quot;... That's all we can really think of for now.

So jump in, and help improve the Twiki.

The Twiki aspires to provide a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and NBS (No Bullshit) version of all the information provided in UW Mechatronics courses, lectures and labs. This can be done by linking to pages that already exist instead of re-writing an explanation, and trimming the fat off of professors' course notes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
WatPD-Engineering is the new replacement for PD-Eng starting the Winter of 2011. It is the result of a year long external review of the PDEng programme and is designed to fix what was widely acknowledged to be a flawed system.

WatPD-Engineering is divided into two mandatory courses and three electives. The mandatory courses have been developped for and are run by WatPD-Engineering. These core courses give students the pre-requisite knowledge for both their coop placements as well as future WatPD electives. The WatPD electives are campus-wide courses that coop students in other faculties have been taking for many years. While electives for engineers are in the works, WatPD-Engineering is focusing on the two core courses and does not expect to develop any core courses in the near future.

WatPD-Engineering is the new replacement for PD-Eng starting the Winter of 2011. It is the result of a year long external review of the PDEng programme and is designed to fix what was widely acknowledged to be a flawed system.

WatPD-Engineering is divided into two mandatory courses and three electives. The mandatory courses have been developped for and are run by WatPD-Engineering. These core courses give students the pre-requisite knowledge for both their coop placements as well as future WatPD electives. The WatPD electives are campus-wide courses that coop students in other faculties have been taking for many years. While electives for engineers are in the works, WatPD-Engineering is focusing on the two core courses and does not expect to develop any core courses in the near future.
